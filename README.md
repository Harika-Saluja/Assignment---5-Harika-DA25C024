## Assignment 5 - Data Analytics Lab

### Name: Harika 
### Roll Number: DA25C024 

#### Documentation: 
##### This assignment explores data veracity issues in a multi-label classification setting using the Yeast gene expression dataset.

##### By applying non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques - t-SNE and Isomap - the assignment visually investigates noisy or ambiguous labels, outliers, and hard-to-learn samples that may challenge model performance.

#### Key tasks completed in this assignment:
    - Loaded and explored the dataset
    - Checked dimension
    - Implemented t-SNE on scaled data
    - Implemented Isomap dimensionality reduction method on scaled data 
    - Analyzed both visualisations and get to the results

### Folder Structure
- `Assignment_5.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook with all solutions
- `yeast.arff` -> file of the dataset
- `README.md` → documentation of the submission  

##### Just need to run Assignment_5.ipynb file keeping the downloaded dataset intact.
